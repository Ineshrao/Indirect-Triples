# Three Address Code - Indirect Triples

## Introduction
Indirect triples are a type of intermediate code representation used in compiler design and optimization. They are based on three-address code (TAC), which represents complex expressions using at most three operands. Indirect triples in TAC allow for more efficient and flexible code generation by using memory addresses as operands instead of explicit values or registers.

## Features and Benefits
- Efficient memory usage: Indirect triples optimize memory usage by using memory addresses instead of explicit values or registers, reducing the memory needed to store intermediate code.
- Flexibility: Indirect triples can be easily modified during optimization phases, enabling the elimination of unnecessary memory accesses, simplification of expressions, and more effective register allocation.
- Support for dynamic memory allocation: Indirect triples are particularly useful for managing data structures like arrays, pointers, and objects in high-level programming languages, as they allow for dynamic memory allocation and access.
- Optimized array and pointer operations: Indirect triples efficiently represent operations on arrays and pointers by using memory addresses to access elements and manipulate pointers.

## Installation Instructions
1. Ensure that you have Python 3.9 installed on your system.
2. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
3. Navigate to the project directory.

## Usage Guide
1. Run the `gui.py` script to launch the application.
2. Enter the infix expression you want to convert into indirect triples.
3. The application will convert the expression into postfix notation and generate the corresponding indirect triples.
4. The indirect triples will be displayed in a tabular format, showing the operation, arguments, and statement locations.
